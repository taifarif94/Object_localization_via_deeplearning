An object inside a miniature water tank was to be localized in a 2D grid (while keeping the height
constant from the ground up). A Piezoelectric transducer transmitted ultrasonic waves through the
water to the object. The reflected echo waves from the object were captured by a receiving transducer.
The training data was collected and a deep learning model was trained.
The Python preprocessing and deep learning programs are uploaded as a Jupyter notebook for a sequential view.
